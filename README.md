triangle-tracker
================

This is a simple app which accepts 3 integers as input and determines what kind of triangle (isosceles, equilateral, or scalene) they create. It also detects invalid triangles (where the three sides would never form a triangle, such as 8, 10, 56).

As a learning project, this demonstrates:
* Writing basic HTML and CSS styling
* Branching
* Using JQuery to accept user input and display a result
